# Qewie Dynamic Color

A dynamic color system for SwiftUI applications. 

This color system is used in my iOS app, [Qewie](https://qewie.app/), and is now open for any and all to learn from, remix, or use in their applications.

The logic this system is based on is take from designer Brad Ellis's talk @ Ã‡ingleton 2012. You can watch it here -> https://vimeo.com/60224584
